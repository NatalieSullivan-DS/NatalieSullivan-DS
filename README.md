## Hi, I'm Natalie! 👋
I am currently a Master's in Data Science student at Ball State University.
🔭 I’m currently exploring **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and text cleaning.
🌱 I’m currently learning how to transform "messy" real-world data into actionable insights.
⚡ Fun fact: I finished my first 16-week programming course in just 8 weeks!

### 🛠 Tech Stack
**Languages:** Python (currently mastering)
**Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, TextBlob

## 🏗️ Current Projects & Roadmap

### 🔍 Project: Sentiment Analysis on User Reviews (Kaggle)
*Currently in the **Data Discovery** phase.*

- [x] Identify target dataset on Kaggle (Text-heavy reviews)
- [ ] Define project scope and analytical questions
- [ ] Develop modular text-cleaning pipeline (using **TextBlob**)
- [ ] Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- [ ] Document findings and sentiment insights

> **Status:** I am currently evaluating datasets on Kaggle to find the perfect "messy" text for a comparative sentiment study. My goal is to apply the NLP concepts I'm mastering in my Master's program to real-world unstructured data.
